This module deploys a [lambda function](https://github.com/cloudposse/lambda-github-action-token-rotator) that runs as 
a GitHub Application and periodically gets a new GitHub Runner Registration Token from the GitHub API. This token is 
then stored in AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store.


> [!TIP]
> #### 👽 Use Atmos with Terraform
> Cloud Posse uses [`atmos`](https://atmos.tools) to easily orchestrate multiple environments using Terraform. <br/>
> Works with [Github Actions](https://atmos.tools/integrations/github-actions/), [Atlantis](https://atmos.tools/integrations/atlantis), or [Spacelift](https://atmos.tools/integrations/spacelift).

## Usage

```hcl
module "github_action_token_rotator" {
    source = "cloudposse/github-action-token-rotator/aws"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version
    # version = "x.x.x"
    parameter_store_token_path       = "/github/runners/cloudposse/registrationToken"
    parameter_store_private_key_path = "/github/runners/cloudposse/privateKey"
    github_app_id                    = "111111"
    github_app_installation_id       = "22222222"
    github_org                       = "cloudposse"
}
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> In Cloud Posse's examples, we avoid pinning modules to specific versions to prevent discrepancies between the documentation
> and the latest released versions. However, for your own projects, we strongly advise pinning each module to the exact version
> you're using. This practice ensures the stability of your infrastructure. Additionally, we recommend implementing a systematic
> approach for updating versions to avoid unexpected changes.
